=========================

Load Distribution Problem Using JGAP Genetic Algorithm Library

1. In loading containers into a vessel, the distribution of weights should be more or less uniform.
2. Holding space for containers assumed to be a grid of MxN and a stack of size S.
3. Lighter containers should be over the heavier ones.
